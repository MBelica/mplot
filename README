Idea for function clf
closing a frame is pretty simple. Is this really necessary?
clf could also close all frames..


Idea for function hold
for each plot check if plot exists in newest frame
    * no: plot
    * yes: check if hold has been callen
        - no: clear frame and repaint
        - yes: draw both

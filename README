# General
Compiled with Java 1.7
UML Diagram: https://repository.genmymodel.com/ProxiStyx/matlabinterface


# Compile
javac -cp "lib/*" -d "bin/" src/*.java
run: (e.g. MPlotTest1)
java -cp "bin/:lib/*" test


# Structure
MPlot (+)
    * main file
    * contains only static to be called by user
Utilities (-)
    * contains all function want to call from several files
    * or could belong into MPlot but aren't mentioned for users
Figure (-)
    * creates simple Frame
Data (-)
    * responsible for conversion of user input into datatable
Plot (-)
    * main file for creating plot including points and lines


# Idea for function clf
closing a frame is pretty simple. Is this really necessary?
clf could also close all frames..


# Idea for function hold
for each plot check if plot exists in newest frame
    * no: plot
    * yes: check if hold has been callen
        - no: clear frame and repaint
        - yes: draw both

# Dispose
Depending on how many graphs active dispose or close
